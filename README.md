# MCDA5510 | React Assignment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Requirements

### A React app with two views (or pages). You can create it by running the create-react-app command.

- **1st Page: "About me"**
    - Add your name as the headline.
    - Write a paragraph about yourself and another paragraph about why you joined the MCDA program

- **2nd Page: "My Town"**
    - Add a picture of your town (could be the city where you currently live or your hometown)
    - Add the town's name (e.g. "I live in Halifax, NS" or "I'm from Beirut, Lebanon") 
    - Add the current weather of that city (see section below)

- **Navigation**
    - Add two <a> tags: "About me" and "My Town" (you can any other tag that you can make clickable)
    - When "About me" is clicked the 1st Page is shown
    - When "My Town" is clicked the 2nd Page is shown
    - Hint: use React Router

- **Current Weather**
  - This is the hardest part of the assignment
  - The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from an API and populate it to the UI
  - You can use an actual Weather API like OpenWeatherMap 
  - Add a picture next to the temperature text (see attachements). The picture should be:    
      - cold.png if the temperature is 10°C or lower
      - mild.png if the temperature is higher than 10°C  but lower than 20°C
      - sunny.png if the temperature is higher than 20°C
